                                To achieve the hollows, one needs to trek through the Ambukutty Mala.
                                It will take around 45 minutes to climb the hill and you will never get baffled in your outing to these historical caves.
                                Inside the cave, you can see two chambers. The lower chamber is 18 ft long, 12 ft wide and 10 ft high and the upper chamber is 96 ft long, 22 ft wide and 18 ft high.
                                You can see animal figures and objects used by humans, on the walls of the caves.<br>
